### How to run ESA CLI commands

If you have installed esa-cli globally, please refer to the following commands for execution.

**Installation**

```
npm i esa-cli@latest -g
```

**Execute commands**

```
esa-cli <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

If you have installed ESA CLI locally in your project (rather than globally), the way to run ESA CLI will depend on your specific setup and package manager.

```
npx esa-cli <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

**You can add ESA CLI commands that you use often as scripts in your project's package.json file:**

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "esa-cli deploy",
    "dev": "esa-cli dev"
  }
  ...
}
```

**Then you can run them using your package manager of choice:**

```
npm run deploy
```
